**Base condition**: The condition under which the recursion stops.

**Recursion tree**: A tree structure where each node can have multiple children, and recursion is used to traverse or manipulate the tree.

**stack overflow**: An error that occurs when the call stack exceeds its limit, often due to excessive recursion without a proper base case.

**stack space**: The amount of memory used by the call stack during recursion.
